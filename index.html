                <h2>I Build Value Through Art.</h2>
                <h4>Here’s a bit about myself, if anyone’s interested! I was a late reader. I never even considered picking up a book until I was about 12 years old, and then BAM, my obsession with books began. I now have a collection of over 200 books (not including eBooks).

                My favorite genres are Fantasy, Science Fiction, Adventure, Romance, and Paranormal/Supernatural. I’m obsessed with Greek Mythology and have plans to write a book series based on it, but for now I’ll just be reading about the topic as much as possible.
                    
                Between my husband and I, we have three cats. A black cat named Esuna (after a spell in the Final Fantasy video game franchise). A calico named Erza (after a character in the Fairy Tail anime series). And lastly a tuxedo cat named Tyrael (the angel from the Diablo video game franchise).
                    
                I’ll choose green tea or matcha over coffee any day of the week! I love playing video games (but have a hard time finishing them because I always want to play ten different games at once).
                    
                I’d say I’m a pretty quirky person, looking at life in a different way than the norm. But that’s how the creative’s brain works, right?
